# Functions needed
Working on the seed and subraces are adding these things I can't handle yet
 - speed modifier
 - Cantrip or spells added,
    specifically or chosen from a spell list,
    with a specific spellcasting stat
 - Extra languages on subrace not working properly I think
 - Are draconic ancestries subraces? may as well be,
    have to add the breath weapon as an attack with the correct type
- Extra skills and stat points in Half-Elf need handling
