The seed file is one big copyright violation, this is a student project and not for profit, sale or public use. If you only used homebrew in a new seed file you might land in a grey area.

# main tasks

Fill out the seed with remaining classes, subclasses, backgrounds, and feats

Different methods of stat assignment

Implement Feats - these can use customMOd for most things I think

#  Bard
   choose three instruments as tools
   equipment_choices -> choose any musical instrument

# Cleric
  double check if I implemented Expertise yet somewhere in the modifier calculation
  remaining subclasses
  -1 spells known, prepared spells should be used instead of spells known limit

# Druid
  specific_spells_choices handling in customModifiers() for circle of the land subclass
  -1 spells known, prepared spells should be used instead of spells known limit

# Spells
   all seeded, submit Modal not working
# heroku
