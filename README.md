The seed file is all-important

# Working Notes
handling levels will require two things
  check for level data in catUpdate and make changes if possible
  have a method just for the level form select that updates everything on the sheet

have to look up the rules to figure out how to calculate some stats

have to do interactive selection for skills, tools, equipment, etc.

have to restyle the whole sheet

spell_lists and the spell chart will require a few big modals

then filling in the seed file with everything in the PHB

then user profiles with Quivers of PCs

then Playsheet, phone version of the sheet with interactivity like damage, rolling, encumbrance tracking, etc.
just a handheld aid for at the table, maybe it's skinnable and highly accessible, internationalized?
